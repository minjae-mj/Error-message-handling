// Problem 

When I load "http://localhost:8080/companies/new", 
it throws error message saying "Cannot Get http://localhost:8080/companies/assets/img/logo-clear.png".

express.static keeps looking for .png file from the route, so I figured there is a problem with the path. 
I simply fixed by letting src start with "/", which will then make it look directory from the root folder. 
For reference, my file structure is designed as below: 

==================
 public 
 ㄴ assets
     ㄴ img
          ㄴ (multiple .png .jpg files) 
 ㄴ css
     ㄴ style.css
 ㄴ js
==================

==================
In dev tools, it looks like this.

localhost:8080
 ㄴ assets/img
 ㄴ css
   ㄴ style.css
 ㄴ companies
   ㄴ new (current) 
==================

// My Code Before 

<body>
    <nav class="nav">
        <div class="nav__container">
            <div class="nav__logo-box">
                <a href="/" class="nav__home"></a>
                <img src="../assets/img/logo-clear.png" alt="logo" class="nav__logo">
                
// My Code After (Solution)

<body>
    <nav class="nav">
        <div class="nav__container">
            <div class="nav__logo-box">
                <a href="/" class="nav__home"></a>
                <img src="/assets/img/logo-clear.png" alt="logo" class="nav__logo">
